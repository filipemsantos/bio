  <h2>Resume</h2>

  <p>I have been an <strong>Enterprise Architect</strong> at <strong>Galp</strong> since <strong>2024</strong>, helping establish the Enterprise Architecture practice, defining its foundation, operating model, and governance framework. I ensure alignment between business strategy and technology execution through capability modelling, enterprise process mapping, and strategic roadmapping. I define current and target-state architectures across business, application, data, and technology domains, creating actionable transformation plans to guide evolution. I also oversee architecture principles and standards, support portfolio rationalisation, and mentor solution teams while promoting architectural best practices across the organisation.</p>

  <p>Previously, I served as a <strong>Solution Architect</strong> at <strong>Polarising</strong> from <strong>2022 to 2024</strong>, working within <strong>Galp’s Commercial Business Unit</strong>, where I led architecture efforts for two major transformation programmes — the Loyalty Platform and Retail Platform initiatives. I collaborated with business stakeholders to translate strategic goals into scalable architectures and provided architectural guidance to delivery teams to ensure alignment with organisational principles.</p>

  <p>Before that, I was a <strong>Senior Integration Engineer</strong> at <strong>Polarising</strong> from <strong>2018 to 2022</strong>, designing and implementing integration solutions for clients such as <strong>Galp</strong> and <strong>TAP Air Portugal</strong>, including the My Booking integration with the Amadeus Global Distribution System. My work centred on <strong>TIBCO-based integration solutions</strong> and system interoperability.</p>

  <p>Between <strong>2012 and 2018</strong>, I worked as an <strong>independent Senior Integration Engineer</strong>, delivering integration services for organisations including <strong>Altice Portugal</strong>, <strong>Santander UK</strong>, and <strong>Santander Chile</strong>, where I designed, migrated, and maintained <strong>TIBCO-based integration solutions</strong>.</p>

  <p>Prior to that, I supported international clients at <strong>Polarising</strong> from <strong>2010 to 2012</strong>, including <strong>Banco do Brasil</strong>, <strong>ING Nederland</strong>, and <strong>Safaricom PLC</strong> on enterprise integration initiatives.</p>

  <p>I began my career at <strong>Portugal Telecom (later Altice Portugal)</strong> in <strong>2006</strong> and remained there until <strong>2010</strong>, initially as a student intern developing a prototype for a digital invoicing platform using Microsoft BizTalk and later as an <strong>Integration Engineer</strong> working with <strong>TIBCO-based integration solutions</strong> on major digital transformation programmes such as CRM One and NSOM, including enterprise-wide integration migrations.</p>

  <p>I hold a degree in <strong>Computer Science and Engineering</strong> from NOVA School of Science and Technology, and certifications including <strong>TOGAF EA Foundation</strong>, <strong>TOGAF EA Practitioner</strong>, and <strong>ITIL-4 Foundation</strong>. I am a native <strong>Portuguese</strong> speaker and fluent in <strong>English</strong> at C1 level.</p>
